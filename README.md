# Basketball-Scoreboard-2.0

This is a basketball score board i built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I added a Timer, A Message Board to show which Player is Winning
and who ultimately won.

Also, i added a Reset which Resets the Game.. 

Notice how the button's go useless after the Game is finished.
